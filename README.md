# Atomic Categorizer

This work is based on great tool created by [Daniel Tonon](https://github.com/Dan503/) which you can try it out here: https://dan503.github.io/Atomic-Categorizer/

*One of the hardest things for new developers to pick up on when it comes to [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) is deciding on what category a particular component should be categorized under.*

This tool is basically a simple quiz that scores each category based on your answers. It then recommends the highest scoring category to you.
